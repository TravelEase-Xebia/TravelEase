This is the **Booking microservice** for the [TravelEase](https://github.com/TravelEase-Xebia/TravelEase) platform.  
It allows users to **browse available flights, book their preferred flight**, and then redirects them to a separate **Payment microservice** for completing the transaction.

## 📦 Features

- Choose **departure location**, **destination**, and **date**.
- Save booking details to a **MongoDB Atlas database**.
- Fetch and display all existing bookings.
- Redirect to **Payment Microservice** after successful booking (integration-ready).

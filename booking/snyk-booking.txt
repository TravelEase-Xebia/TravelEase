Open Issues

 âœ— [MEDIUM] Information Exposure
   Path: server.js, line 7
   Info: Disable X-Powered-By header for your Express app (consider using Helmet middleware), because it exposes information about the used framework to potential attackers.

 âœ— [MEDIUM] Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
   Path: server.js, line 13
   Info: Expensive operation (a file system operation) is performed by an endpoint handler which does not use a rate-limiting mechanism. It may enable the attackers to perform Denial-of-service attacks. Consider using a rate-limiting middleware such as express-limit.

 âœ— [HIGH] Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
   Path: server.js, line 39
   Info: Unsanitized user input from an HTTP parameter flows into RegExp, where it is used to build a regular expression. This may result in a Regular expression Denial of Service attack (reDOS).

 âœ— [HIGH] Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
   Path: server.js, line 40
   Info: Unsanitized user input from an HTTP parameter flows into RegExp, where it is used to build a regular expression. This may result in a Regular expression Denial of Service attack (reDOS).
